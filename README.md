js-dragndrop
============

Drag and Drop tool for Javascript which deals with scale transforms (`transform:scale(x)` and its browser-specific variants)

This software isn't plenty functional yet. At this point, it works well if the draggable _elements_ belong to the same parent.

Further, it's expected to define some commonly used default behaviors for dragging (e.g. uses ghost image or the same element), to handle with expected target elements and collision events.

**requirements:**
jQuery 1.8.2+
